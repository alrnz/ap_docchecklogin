This extension integrates the popular DocCheck Login Service with your TYPO3
6.x-Website. It is currently maintained by antwerpes ag (a subsidiary of
DocCheck AG), in close cooperation with DocCheck.

It supports the **basic functionality** by logging in a dummy frontend user
whenever someone has been authorized by DocCheck.

It supports the **Unique Key feature** (optional, requires license *Economy*
or higher), which allows you to identify returning visitors, by creating one
frontend user per unique DocCheck User.

It supports the **DocCheck Routing feature** family, allowing you to configure
different frontend user groups for different routing targets.

It supports the **DocCheck Personal feature** (optional, requires license
*Business* and the Unique Key feature), which will augment your Unique
DocCheck User by some person-related data – given, that the user agrees
to this data transmission.

It supports the **DocCheck Crawler feature** to add your protected content in the DocCheck Search Engine index.
With this powerful feature your valuable content will be searchable for healthcare professionals.
